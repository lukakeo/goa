<!-- 
Browser vendors used to add prefixes to experimental or nonstandard CSS properties and JavaScript APIs, so developers could experiment with new ideas.
This, in theory, helped to prevent their experiments from being relied upon and then breaking web developers' code during the standardization process.



    The most common browser CSS prefixes you will see in older code bases include:

-webkit- (Chrome, Safari, newer versions of Opera and Edge, almost all iOS browsers including Firefox for iOS; basically, any WebKit or Chromium-based browser)
-moz- (Firefox)
-o- (old pre-WebKit versions of Opera)
-ms- (Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge, before Chromium)
-->


<!-- 
    The :root CSS pseudo-class matches the root element of a tree representing the document. In HTML, :root represents the <html> element and is identical to the selector html, except that its specificity is higher.
