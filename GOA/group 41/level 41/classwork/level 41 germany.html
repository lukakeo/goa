        <h2 style="color: white;">Travelling costs money, and even though there are a lot of countries that are more expensive than Germany, it is certainly not one of the cheapest holiday destinations. The longer you want to spend 
        exploring Germany,the more this applies,of course: travel, accommodation, food and drink are necessary expenses. One option is to earn the cost of your trip in Germany itself while you are there
        The restaurant landscape in Germany is practically unlimited and highly diverse. In big cities in particular it is possible to find almost every type of international cuisine, often in gourmet
        quality,too. Virtually every town in Germany has a pizzeria, a kebab restaurant or a Chinese restaurant serving good food that is reasonably priced. But tourists will want to try the countryâ€™s own 
        typical dishes and drinks, too. Some dishes require a little tolerance, unlike perhaps the most common German drinks such as beer and wine.</h2>
